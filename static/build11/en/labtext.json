        "A type of §bslide§r with a §bsample holder§r is used to introduce the sample into the mass spectrometer. Liquid samples are filled into small\n§btest tubes§r.

In the ionization chamber, the electrons §bcollide§r with the molecules of the sample, §bknock§r\n§belectrons out§r of them and thus generate §bpositively charged ions§r.
